# Google Event Schema Script

This JS script automatically generates and appends [Google Event structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/event) (`application/ld+json`) to the `<head>` of pages that feature event information in order increase SEO effectiveness and provide rich search result enhancements. 

I originally wrote this for a website that used the Divi Wordpress theme, however it can be adapted for any HTML page.

**You are most welcome to use this code in your commercial projects, all that I ask in return is that you credit my work by providing a link back to this repository. Thank you & Enjoy!**

## Features

- **Automatic detection**: Runs only on event pages (checks for `.e-name`).
- **Schema.org compliant**: Generates JSON-LD structured data for events.
- **Supports multiple 'locations'**: Handles both physical and online events.
- **Supports multiple offers**: Extracts ticket/offer details including price, currency, and validity.
- **Handles images**: Collects `.png` images for event schema.
- **Organizer details**: Adds organizer name and URL.
- **Time zone aware**: Builds proper ISO 8601 start and end times with offset.

## How It Works

1. Waits for the `DOMContentLoaded` event.
2. Checks if `.e-name` exists to confirm itâ€™s an event page.
3. Extracts event details from Divi classes:
   - **Name**: `.e-name`
   - **Dates/Times**: `.e-start-date`, `.e-start-time`, `.e-end-date`, `.e-end-time`, `.e-timezone-offset`
   - **Attendance Mode**: `.e-event-attendance-mode` (`Offline`, `Online`, or `Offline and Online`)
   - **Locations**: `.e-location-name`, `.e-location-type`, `.e-streetAddress`, `.e-addressLocality`, `.e-postalCode`, `.e-addressRegion`, `.e-addressCountry`
   - **Images**: `.e-images`
   - **Description**: `.e-description`
   - **Offers**: `.e-offer-name`, `.e-offer-price`, `.e-offer-currency`, `.e-offer-validFrom`, `.e-offer-url`
   - **Organizer**: `.e-organizer-name`, `.e-organizer-url`
4. Builds a JSON-LD schema object.
5. Injects it into the `<head>` of the document for Google to crawl.
